# This Dependabot config is disabled. We are using Renovate for dependency
# updates instead. This file is kept here for reference, in case we want to
# switch back to Dependabot in the future.

# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates
